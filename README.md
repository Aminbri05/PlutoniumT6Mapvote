This project is a project that started in March 2020. The script allows players to vote for the next map or/and mode to be played in the next game. The project will not provide compiled files so you will have to compile the file if required using the [gsc-tool](https://github.com/xensik/gsc-tool).

## Support
- **multiplayer** *(Call of Duty: World at War)* `PC`, `XBOX`, `PS3`
- **zombies** *(Call of Duty: Black Ops)* `PC`

## Usage
Configuration guides are written within the appropriate folders.
